## About this guide

This is a short "step by step" guide that helps to prevent / fix some common errors during WSL installation.

This document was written as a useful note due to lack of comprehensive and straightforward instructions. As we all know, Microsoft is quite huge corp having different dev-teams working separately, thus if people still facing issues with WSL installation since so many years, the underlying cause is definitely related to subproducts isolation and bad cooperation between dev-teams. You'll see for yourself that security team (Windows Defender) and WSL team may have quite bad collaboration during releases, and this guide prooves this fact.

Obviously, I am unable to give 100% guarantee that it will work on future WSL and Windows updates, but it worked nicely since 2024 and will work some time ahead.

### Requirements/Target

- Windows 11 Pro
- Windows 10 Pro

## **Step by step guide**

**Step 1.** Enabling Windows features related to virtualization

Start typing to search in Start menu:

_**feat**_

and open suggested Control panel applet called:

**Turn Windows features on or off**

In Windows features list enable following features:  
(there is no need to reinstall any if already enabled)

- Hyper-V
- Virtual Machine Platform
- Windows Hypervisor platform
- Windows Subsystem for Linux

**Step 2.** Restart PC

**Step 3.** Running console commands

Subsequently run following commands as Administrator from CMD or Powershell:  
(there is nothing bad in repeating, if you already entered them many times trying to make things work)

`net start vmms`

`dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart`

`dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`

`wsl --set-default-version 2`

**Step 4.** Updating WSL engine

Update WSL engine/kernel by downloading and installing MSI package:

[https://aka.ms/wsl2kernelmsix64](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernelmsix64)

Additionally (**recommended**) run Windows Update and check for updates to install them (wsl engine update usually goes from there).

**Step 5.** Granting access in Windows Defender for virtual machine services (the main panacea!)

Start typing to search in Start menu:

_**exploit**_

and open suggested Windows Defender applet called:

**Exploit protection**

In Exploit protection settings window:

Click **Add program to customize** > **Choose extract file path**:  
Choose file

`c:\windows\system32\vmcompute.exe`

Click added file and click **Edit.**

Scroll down a bit to option called **Control folw guard (CFG)**

Enable checkbox called **Enable Override System settings**

Switch it into **On** state and enable checkbox **Use srtict CFG**

Add another system executable same way by enabling the "CFG" thing for it:

`c:\windows\system32\vmwp.exe`

**Step 5.** Install/register WSL distribution that suits your liking. Following command is an example of deploying the Ununtu 22.04 LTS:

`wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04`

That's all. Linux system will start without errors and you will see promt for entering user name and password.
